          <h3> Challenge </h3>
          <p> The only requirement for this assignment was to create a  data visualization in a non-traditional medium. In other words, absolutely no paper allowed!  Having just been trained on the laser cutter, I decided to use my new skills to create a clock face out of wood.   </p>
          <h3 id="ideation">Ideation and Sketching</h3>
          <p>I came into this assignment knowing I wanted to depict ecological succession. Ecological succession is the process by which a biological community evolves over time and how it establishes itself after it has been destroyed. If you’re interested in learning more, checking out <a link="#">this newsletter</a> released by the US Forest Service is a great place to start. Since ecological succession is an inhernetly cyclical process, I knew the end product had to be circular in some way but I didn’t land on the final clock format till much later. </p>
          <img class ="sketch" src="./images/laser/clocksketches.jpg" alt="final product of laser cut clock">
          <p>I began by sketchig the various steps of ecological succesion in circles. One of the first drafts of drawings is shown above. Since a laser cutter is more successful at cutting around larger shapes versus thin lines, all the pen images I decided on had to be simplified to play to the laser cutter’s strengths. </p>
          <h3>Test Cuts</h3>
          <p>Once I had simplifed the drawings I moved them into illustrator. My first thought was to cut all the way through the wood to display the images so I ran I tested a few of the designs on 4 by 4 inch blocks.  As you can see from the test block shown below, some of the areas in the bug were far too thin and ended up breaking. This problem wasn't limited only to the bug but affected more than half of the designs. Further, if each image on the clock were a circle with this diameter of 4 inch, the entirety of the clock would have to be nearly 2 feet across! That’s nearly the size of a end table, not a reasonable size for a clock.</p>
          <h3>Final Decisions</h3>
          <p>Given that I wanted the clock to be no more than a foot in diameter, cutting the images completely out of wood was  out of the quetion. The pieces in the images would be too thin once cut and would fall apart. Instead, I engraved all the pictures about 1/4 of an inch into the wood. This allowed both contrast between the engraved and untouched areas of the wood and also gave the images the stability they needed to hold together. </p>
