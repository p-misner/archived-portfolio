          <h3> Challenge </h3>
          <p> Data are just facts until they are presented in relation to each other- only then do the become information. The goal of this project is to assess the relationship between different data sets and present them visually instead of textually.  </p>
          <p> The main data set used in this project is a collection of nutrition facts of 12 classic breakfast foods: Bacon Egg and Cheese Sandwhich, Cap'n Cruch Peanut Butter, Cranberry Orange Muffin, Frosted Flakes, Grape Nuts, Plain Greek Yogurt, Leftover Pizza, Pop Tarts, Raisin Bran, Scrambled Eggs, Sliced Fish Congee and Swiss MÃ¼esli, </p>
          <h3> Research</h3>
          <p> While reserching into the nutrition facts of these foods, I pulled up the United State Goverment Nutrition guidlines and discovered the there were large discrepancies between the Daily Recommended Value* for nutrients and the government recommendations for different age groups. For examples, the DRV statest that an average person requires 2000 caloreis a day while the government recommends that males 19-30 get 2400 calores a day.</p>
           <p>Rather than simply comparing the nutrition facts of each food to one another in my infographic, I decided to instead display the percentage difference the govenment's recommendations for men and women aged 19-30 deviates from the government's daily recommended value for all age groups. In doing so, I hope this graphic informs the reader that the daily recommended value is not the gold standard for how much to consume but is instead a (largely inaccurate) benchmark for consumers.     </p>
          <p> To check out the data, check out the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/labelingnutrition/ucm2006828.htm"> Guidance for Industry: Food Labeling Guide </a>for the FDA's food labeling guidelines or visit the <a href="https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/appendix-7/"> Nurition Guidelines </a> for the government's daily recommended values breakdown by age and gender.</p>
          <p class="asterix"> *these are the numbers displayed in the nutrition fact section on all the food you buy </p>
          <h3> Results</h3>
          <p> This visulalization is based on a bar graph with the axis flipped. The y-axis contains the labels while the x-axis dispalys the percentage difference from zero. A third dimension of information is added by using the data points to symbolise whether the data is representing the difference men or women.    </p>
